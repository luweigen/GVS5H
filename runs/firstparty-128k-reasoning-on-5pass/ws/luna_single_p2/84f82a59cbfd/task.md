### Question
A positive integer N is a 400 number if and only if it satisfies both of the following two conditions:

- N has exactly 2 distinct prime factors.
- For each prime factor p of N, p divides N an even number of times. More formally, the maximum non-negative integer k such that p^k divides N is even.

Process Q queries. Each query gives you an integer A, so find the largest 400 number not exceeding A. Under the constraints of this problem, a 400 number not exceeding A always exists.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
Q
\text{query}_1
\text{query}_2
\vdots
\text{query}_Q

Here, \text{query}_i is the i-th query, given in the following format:
A

Output

Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Constraints


- 1 \leq Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
- For each query, 36 \leq A \leq 10^{12}.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5
404
36
60
1000000000000
123456789

Sample Output 1

400
36
36
1000000000000
123454321

Let us explain the first query.
There are exactly 2 prime factors of 400: 2 and 5. Also, 2 divides 400 four times and 5 divides it twice, so 400 is a 400 number. None of 401, 402, 403, and 404 is a 400 number, so the answer is 400.

### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs). Enclose your code within delimiters as follows. Ensure that when the python program runs, it reads the inputs, runs the algorithm and writes output to STDOUT.
