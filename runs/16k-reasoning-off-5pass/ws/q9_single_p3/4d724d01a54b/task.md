### Question
You are given a permutation P = (P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N) of (1, 2, \ldots, N). Takahashi can repeatedly perform the following operation on P (possibly zero times):

- Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq N-1. Pay a cost of i, and swap P_i and P_{i+1}.

Find the minimum total cost required to sort P in ascending order.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
P_1 P_2 \ldots P_N

Output

Print the minimum total cost required to sort P in ascending order.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- (P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N) is a permutation of (1, 2, \ldots, N).
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3
3 2 1

Sample Output 1

4

Takahashi can sort P in ascending order as follows:

- Pay a cost of 1 and swap P_1 = 3 and P_2 = 2. Now, P = (2, 3, 1).
- Pay a cost of 2 and swap P_2 = 3 and P_3 = 1. Now, P = (2, 1, 3).
- Pay a cost of 1 and swap P_1 = 2 and P_2 = 1. Now, P = (1, 2, 3).

The total cost for these operations is 4, which is the minimum possible.

### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs). Enclose your code within delimiters as follows. Ensure that when the python program runs, it reads the inputs, runs the algorithm and writes output to STDOUT.
