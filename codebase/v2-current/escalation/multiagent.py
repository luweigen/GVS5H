"""Multi-agent collaborative solver: a primary "manager" plus worker subagents,
coordinating over a SHARED FILESYSTEM WORKSPACE. Emulates the Claude-Code
orchestrator/subagent pattern, but every role is the SAME model
(default groq:qwen/qwen3.6-27b) invoked in a fresh context.

Control flow (as requested):
  1. PRIMARY writes an overarching plan and seeds the task list.
  2. The FIRST WORKER just thinks about the problem and proposes approaches.
  3. Loop: PRIMARY decides which task to prioritize and spawns a worker; the
     worker completes it, updates the shared code/proof, and proposes next steps.
     Primary stops when it judges the problem solved (or the iteration budget
     runs out).
  4. A FINALIZE worker emits the definitive artifact, which is then graded.

Shared workspace (real files, so every role sees the same evolving state):
    <ws>/task.md      the problem statement
    <ws>/plan.md      the primary's overarching plan
    <ws>/notes.md     curated ideas / proofs / findings       (read by every role; each
                      worker REWRITES it rather than appending, so it stays organised and
                      bounded -- append-only growth used to blow past the context window)
    <ws>/solution.py  current best code   (code problems)     (read by every role)
    <ws>/answer.md    current best answer  (math problems)     (read by every role)
    <ws>/transcript.jsonl  every call for this problem (see _record); not read by any role
    <ws>/tasks.json   debug dump of the task list [{id, desc, status, result}] -- written
                      after each manager round but NOT read back by any role. The live task
                      list is the in-memory `tasks` value threaded through the loop and
                      re-rendered into the manager's prompt; `id` is renumbered from 1 on
                      each curation and `result` is always "" (neither is used downstream).
