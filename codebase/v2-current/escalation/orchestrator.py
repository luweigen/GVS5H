"""Hierarchical multi-model escalation over local ollama.

Configuration (as requested):
  - A ladder of qwen3.5 models ordered by size/capability.
  - For each problem: the SMALLEST model solves, then a second instance of the
    same model critiques. Solver and critic pass the answer back and forth until
    the critic is satisfied (APPROVED) or a per-layer round cap is hit.
  - The satisfied answer is then handed UP to the next (larger) layer as a
    reference candidate, which runs the same solve<->critique loop to improve it.
  - The top layer's approved answer is the final output.

Talks to ollama's /api/chat directly (no extra deps; stdlib urllib only).

    Not interchangeable with the OpenAI-compatible path, and the differences are forced
    by the API rather than chosen here:
      - Opus 5 caps output at 128K. A larger ESCALATION_CLOUD_MAX_TOKENS is CLAMPED (not
        rejected), and the clamp is recorded, so a run cannot silently claim a cap it never
        actually had. max_tokens bounds THINKING PLUS ANSWER TOGETHER, so a problem can
        spend the whole cap reasoning and return no text at all; that lands as `truncated`
        and is a real outcome, not a bug to be capped around -- 128K is the ceiling.
      - Thinking is adaptive and on by default, and RAW thinking tokens are never returned.
        `meta["reasoning"]` therefore holds Anthropic's SUMMARY of the thinking, not the
        chain of thought -- unlike the vLLM arms, where it is the real thing.
        `meta["reasoning_is_summary"]` marks that in the transcript so the two cannot be
        read as the same kind of evidence later.
      - `temperature` is not sent: non-default sampling is rejected alongside thinking.
      - Streaming is required at these output sizes; the final message is reassembled here.

    Thinking DEPTH is the one thing here that is chosen rather than forced: ANTHROPIC_EFFORT
